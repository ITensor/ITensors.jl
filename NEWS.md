This file is a (mostly) comprehensive list of changes made in each release of ITensors.jl. For a completely comprehensive but more verbose list, see the [commit history on Github](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl/commits/main).

While we are in v0.x of the package, we will follow the convention that updating from v0.x.y to v0.x.(y+1) (for example v0.1.15 to v0.1.16) should not break your code, unless you are using internal/undocumented features of the code, while updating from `v0.x.y` to `v0.(x+1).y` might break your code, though we will try to add deprecation warnings when possible, such as for simple cases where the name of a function changes.

Note that as of Julia v1.5, in order to see deprecation warnings you will need to start Julia with `julia --depwarn=yes` (previously they were on by default). Please run your code like this before upgrading between minor versions of the code (for example from v0.1.41 to v0.2.0).

After we release v1 of the package, we will start following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

ITensors v0.3.5 Release Notes
=============================

Bugs:

Enhancements:

- Generalize `op` to handle `Matrix`/`String` inputs more generically (#899)

ITensors v0.3.4 Release Notes
=============================

Bugs:

Enhancements:

- Simplify rrules for Index manipulation of ITensors (#888)
- Add some helper functions like converting element types of ITensors (#898)
  - `cu([A, B])` -> `[cu(A), cu(B)]` (same for `cpu`).
  - `cu([[A, B], [C]])` -> `[[cu(A), cu(B)], [cu(C)]]` (same for `cpu`).
  - `convert_eltype(T::Type, A::ITensor)` - convert the element type of an ITensor to `T`.
  - `convert_leaf_eltype(T, A::MPS)` - convert the element types of the ITensors of an MPS/MPO.
  - `convert_leaf_eltype(T, [[A, B], C])` - convert the element types of ITensors `A`, `B`, `C` in a nested data structure (useful for layered gate structures used in PastaQ).
  - `contract(A::MPS)` - contract the ITensors of an MPS/MPO into an ITensor (previously we used `prod` for that but I think using ` contract` is clearer).
  - `array(A::ITensor, i::Index, j::Index, ...)` - convert the ITensor to an Array, first permuting into the Index ordering `i, j, ...`. Previously I used `array(permute(A, i, j, ...))` for this but this is more convenient.
  - `A(x)` as a simpler syntax for `apply(A::ITensor, x::ITensor)`, treating `A` as an operator from unprimed to primed indices. I've already defined this syntax for `MPO` and `MPS` and I think it is pretty nice. I was holding off on doing this for a while to see if there might be a better meaning for `A(B)` but 
  - Define `complex`, `real`, `imag`, and `conj` for MPS/MPO by applying them to the ITensors of the MPS/MPO. Maybe there is a better meaning for these, as in the MPS that is the real part of the MPS defined as a state?

ITensors v0.2.0 Release Notes
==============================

Breaking changes:
-----------------

- Change QN convention of the Qubit site type to track the total number of 1 bits instead of the net number of 1 bits vs 0 bits (i.e. change the QN from +1/-1 to 0/1) (PR #676).
- Remove `IndexVal` type in favor of `Pair{<:Index}`. `IndexVal{IndexT}` is now an alias for `Pair{IndexT,Int}`, so code using `IndexVal` such as `IndexVal(i, 2)` should generally still work. However, users should change from `IndexVal(i, 2)` to `i => 2` (PR #665).
- Rename the `state` functions currently defined for various site types to `val` for mapping a string name for an index to an index value (used in ITensor indexing and MPS construction). `state` functions now return single-index ITensors representing various single-site states (PR #664).
- `maxlinkdim(::MPO/MPS)` returns a minimum of `1` (previously it returned 0 for MPS/MPO without and link indices) (PR #663).
- The `NDTensors` module has been moved into the `ITensors` package, so `ITensors` no longer depends on the standalone `NDTensors` package. This should only effect users who were using both `NDTensors` and `ITensors` seperately. If you want to use the latest `NDTensors` library, you should do `using ITensors.NDTensors` instead of `using NDTensors`, and will need to install `ITensors` with `using Pkg; Pkg.add("ITensors")` in order to use the latest versions of `NDTensors`. Note the current `NDTensors.jl` package will still exist, but for now developmentof `NDTensors` will occur within `ITensors.jl` (PR # 650).
- `ITensor` constructors from collections of `Index`, such as `ITensor(i, j, k)`, now return an `ITensor` with `EmptyStorage` (previously called `Empty`) storage instead of `Dense` or `BlockSparse` storage filled with 0 values. Most operations should still work that worked previously, but please contact us if there are issues (PR #641).
- ITensors now store a `Tuple` of `Index` instead of an `IndexSet` (PR #626).
- The ITensor type no longer has separate field `inds` and `store`, just a single field `tensor` (PR #626).
- The `IndexSet{T}` type has been redefined as a type alias for `Vector{T<:Index}` (which is subject to change to some other collection of indices, and likely will be removed in ITensors v0.3). Therefore it no longer has a type parameter for the number of indices, similar to the change to the `ITensor` type. If you were using the plain `IndexSet` type, code should generally still work properly. In general you should not have to use `IndexSet`, and can just use `Tuple` or `Vector` of `Index` instead, such as `is = (i, j, k)` or `is = [i, j, k]`. Priming, tagging, and set operations now work generically on those types (PR #626).
- ITensor constructors from Array now only convert to floating point for `Array{Int}` and `Array{Complex{Int}}`. That same conversion is added for QN ITensor constructors to be consistent with non-QN versions (PR #620) (@mtfishman).
- The tensor order type paramater has been removed from the `ITensor` type, so you can no longer write `ITensor{3}` to specify an order 3 ITensor (PR #591) (@kshyatt).

Deprecations:
-----------------

- `Index(::Int)` and `getindex(i::Index, n::Int)` are deprecated in favor of `Pair` syntax (using `i => 3` instead of `i(3)` or `i[3]`) (PR #665).
- `Base.iterate(i::Index, state = 1)` is deprecated in favor of `eachindval` (PR #665).
- Deprecate `MPO(::MPS)` in favor of `outer(::MPS, ::MPS)` (PR #663).
- Add `OpSum` as alternative (preferred) name to `AutoMPO` (PR #663).
- `noise!(::Sweeps, ...)` and `cutoff!(::Sweeps, ...)` are deprecated in favor of `setnoise!` and `setsweeps!` (PR #624).
- `emptyITensor(Any)` is deprecated in favor of `emptyITensor()` (PR #620).
- `store` is deprecated in favor of `storage` for getting the storage of an ITensor. Similarly `ITensors.setstore[!]` -> `ITensors.setstorage[!]` (PR #620).

Bug fixes and new features:
-----------------

- Fix bug when taking the exponential of a QN ITensor with missing diagonal blocks (PR #682).
- Generalize indexing to with `end` to allow arithmetic such as `A[i => end - 1, j => 2]` (PR #679).
- Allow Pair inputs in `swaptags` and `swapinds`, i.e. `swaptags(A, "i" => "j")` and `swapinds(A, i => j)` (PR #676).
- Fix negating of QN ITensor (PR #672) (@emstoudenmire).
- Add support for indexing into ITensors with strings, such as `s = siteind("S=1/2"); T = randomITensor(s); T[s => "Up"]` (indices must have tags that have `val` overloads) (PR #665).
- Add `eachindval(::Index)` and `eachval(::Index)` for iterating through the values of an Index (PR #665).
- Rename the `state` functions currently defined for various site types to `val` for mapping a string name for an index to an index value (used in ITensor indexing and MPS construction). `state` functions now return single-index ITensors representing various single-site states (PR #664).
- Out-of-place broadcasting on MPS that maps ITensors to ITensors like `2 .* psi` will return an MPS (previously it returned a `Vector{ITensor}`) (PR #663).
- Add `outer(psi::MPS, phi::MPS)::MPO -> |psi><phi|` to do an outer product of two `MPS` and `projector(psi::MPS)::MPO -> |psi><psi|`, deprecate `MPO(::MPS)` in favor of these (PR #663).
- Redefine `eltype(::MPS/MPO)` as ITensor, i.e. the actual element type of the storage data, thinking about the MPS as a `Vector{ITensor}`. This matches better with how `eltype` is used in general in Julia, and therefore helps MPS by more compatible with what generic Julia code expects (like broadcasting, where an issue related to this came up). A new function `promote_itensor_eltype(::MPS/MPO)` returns the promoted element types of the ITensors of the MPS to replace the old functionality (PR #663).
- Fix a bug in broadcasting an MPS/MPO such as `psi .*= 2` where previously it wasn't expanding the orthogonality limits to the edge of the system. Also now out-of-place broadcasting like `2 .* psi` will return an MPS (previously it returned a Vector{ITensor}) (PR #663).
- Fix bug in `MPO(::AutoMPO, ::Vector{<:Index})` where for fermionic models the AutoMPO was being modified in-place (PR #659) (@mtfishman).
- Add `Array` to `MPS` constructor (PR #649).
- Faster noise term in DMRG (PR #623)
- Add `expect` and `correlation_matrix` to help measure expectation values and correlation matrices of MPS (PR #622).
- Add `real`, `imag`, `conj` for ITensors (PR #621).
- ITensor constructors from Array now only convert to floating point for `Array{Int}` and `Array{Complex{Int}}`. That same conversion is added for QN ITensor constructors to be consistent with non-QN versions (PR #620) (@mtfishman).
- New ITensor constructors like `itensor(Int, [0 1; 1 0], i, j)` to specify the exact element type desired (PR #620) (@mtfishman).
- Make QN ITensor constructor error in case of no blocks (PR #617).
- Speed up `randomITensor` with `undef` constructor (PR #616) (@emstoudenmire).
- Fix definition of `Adagdn` for Electron (PR #615) (@emstoudenmire).
- Add `onehot` as new name for `setelt` (PR #615) (@emstoudenmire).
- Support `randomMPS(ComplexF64,s,chi)` (PR #615) (@emstoudenmire).
- Make TagSet code cleaner and more generic, and improve constructor from String performance (PR #610) (@saolof).
- Define some missing methods for AbstractMPS broadcasting (#609) (@kshyatt).
- Make ops less strict about input (PR #602) (@emstoudenmire).
- Add support for using `end` in `setindex!` for ITensors (PR #596) (@mtfishman).
- Contraction sequence optimization (PR #589) (@mtfishman).

==============================
- New MPS/MPO index manipulation interface (PR #575) (@mtfishman).
- Add support for `inner(::MPS, ::MPO, ::MPS)` with multiple siteinds per tensor (PR #573) (@mtfishman).
- Fix `MPO*MPS`, `MPO*MPO` for system sizes 1 and 2 (PR #572) (@mtfishman).
- Add generic support for scalar ITensor contraction (PR #569) (@mtfishman).
- Fix and add tests for printing QN diag ITensors (PR #568) (@mtfishman).

ITensors v0.1.37 Release Notes
==============================
- Bump to NDTensors v0.1.23 which fixes a bug in block sparse multithreading when a block sparse tensor contraction results in a tensor with no blocks (PR #565) (@mtfishman).

ITensors v0.1.36 Release Notes
==============================
- Bump to v0.1.22 of NDTensors which introduces block sparse multithreading. Add documentation and examples for using block sparse multithreading (PR #561) (@mtfishman).
- Make dmrg set ortho center to 1 before starting (PR #562) (@emstoudenmire).

ITensors v0.1.35 Release Notes
==============================
Closed issues:

- Should we define iterate for TagSet? (#542)
- AutoMPO slower than expected (#555)

Merged pull requests:

- Implement iterate for TagSet (#553) (@tomohiro-soejima)
- Add check for Index arrows for map! (includes sum and difference etc) (#554) (@emstoudenmire)
- Optimize AutoMPO (#556) (@mtfishman)
- Add checks for common site indices in DMRG, dot, and inner (#557) (@mtfishman)
- Fix and Improve DMRGObserver Constructor (#558) (@emstoudenmire)
- Update HDF5 to versions 0.14, 0.15 (#559) (@emstoudenmire)

ITensors v0.1.34 Release Notes
==============================
* Allow operator names in the `op` system that are longer than 8 characters (PR #551).

ITensors v0.1.33 Release Notes
==============================
* Fix bug introduced in v0.1.32 involving inner(::MPS, ::MPS) if the MPS have more than one site Index per tensor (PR #549).

ITensors v0.1.32 Release Notes
==============================
* Update to NDTensors v0.1.21, which includes a bug fix for scalar-like tensor contractions involving mixed element types (NDTensors PR #58).
* Docs for observer system and DMRGObserver (PR #546).
* Add `ITensors.@debug_check`, `ITensors.enable_debug_checks()`, and `ITensors.disable_debug_checks()` for denoting that a block of code is a debug check, and turning on and off debug checks (off by default). Use to check for repeated indices in IndexSet construction and other checks (PR #547).
* Add `index_id_rng()`, an RNG specifically for generating Index IDs. Set the seed with `Random.seed!(index_id_rng(), 1234)`. This makes the random stream of number seperate for Index IDs and random elements, and helps avoid Index ID clashes with reading and writing (PR #547).
* Add back checking for proper QN Index directions in contraction (PR #547).

ITensors v0.1.31 Release Notes
==============================
* Update to NDTensors v0.1.20, which includes some more general block sparse slicing operations as well as optimizations for contracting scalar-like (length 1) tensors (NDTensors PR #57).
* Add flux of IndexVal functionality which returns the QN multiplied by the direction of the Index. Make `qn` consistently return the bare QN. Might be breaking for people who were calling `qn(::IndexVal)` and related functions, since now it consistently returns the QN not modified by the Index direction (PR #543).
* Introduce `splitblocks` function for Index, ITensor and MPS/MPO. This splits the QNs of the specified indices into blocks of size 1 and drops nonzero blocks, which can make certain tensors more sparse and improve efficiency. This is particularly useful for Hamiltonian MPOs. Thanks to Johannes Hauschild for pointing out this strategy (PR #540).
* Add Ising YY and ZZ gates to qubits examples (PR #539).

ITensors v0.1.30 Release Notes
==============================
* Update to NDTensors v0.1.19, which includes various block sparse optimizations. The primary change is switching the block-offset storage from a sorted vector to a dictionary for O(1) lookup of the offsets. Note this may be a slightly breaking change for users that were doing block operations of block sparse tensors since now blocks have a special type Block that stores a tuple of the block location and the hash (NDTensors PR #54 and ITensors PR #538).

ITensors v0.1.29 Release Notes
==============================
* Add global flag for combining before contracting QN ITensors, control with enable/disable_combine_contract!(). This can speed up the contractions of high order QN ITensors (PR #536).
* Fix bug when using "end" syntax when indexing ITensors where the Index ordering doesn't match the internal ITensor Index order (PR #537).
* Increase NDTensors to v0.1.18, which includes a variety of dense and sparse contraction optimizations.

ITensors v0.1.28 Release Notes
==============================
* Add support for setting slices of an ITensor (PR #535).
* Add bond dimension maximum in addition of MPS/MPO based on sums of bond dimensions of original MPS/MPO (PR # 535).
* Add TBLIS contraction support. When TBLIS.jl is installed, the command "using TBLIS" turns on TBLIS support. enable_tblis!() and disable_tblis!() also turn TBLIS backend on and off (PR #533).
* Add DMRG and contraction examples of using TBLIS contraction backend (PR #533).

==============================
* Introduce a density matrix algorithm for summing arbitrary numbers of MPS/MPO (non-QN and QN) (PR #528).

* Introduce the ortho_lims(::MPS/MPO) function, that returns the orthogonality limits as a range (PR #528).
* Improves the (::Number * ::MPS/MPO) function by ensuring the number scales an MPS/MPO tensor within the orthogonality limits (PR #528).
* Improve functionality for making an MPO that is a product of operators. In particular, MPO(s, "Id") now works for QN sites, and it adds notation like: MPO(s, n -> isodd(n) ? "S+" : "S-") (PR #528).
* Add SiteType and op documentation.
* Add unexported function ITensors.examples_dir to get examples directory.

index of an ITensor (i.e. for an `d x d` ITensor, either `1:d^2` or
`(1,1), (1,2), ..., (d, d)`). For sparse ITensors, this includes
structurally zero and nonzero entries.
  * Add `iterate(A::ITensor, args...)`, which allows using `for a in A
@show a end` to print all elements (zero and nonzero, for sparse
tensors).
  * Add `setindex!(T::ITensor, x::Number, I::CartesianIndex)` to allow
indexing with a `CartesianIndex`, which is naturally returned by
functions like `eachindex`.
  * Add `hasplev(pl::Int)` that returns a function `x -> hasplev(x, pl)`
(useful in functions like `map`).
  * Add `hasind[s](i::Index)` that returns a function `x -> hasind[s](x, i)`
(useful in functions like `map`).
  * Add `hascommoninds(A, B; kwargs...)` which returns true if `A` and `B`
have common indices.
  * Add `findfirstsiteind(M::MPS/MPO, s::Index)` that returns which site
of the MPS/MPO has the site index `s`.
  * Add `findfirstsiteinds(M::MPS/MPO, is)` that returns which site
of the MPS/MPO has the site indices `is`.
  * Add `linkinds(::MPS/MPO)` that returns a vector of the link indices.

(the inputs were getting orthogonalized and the prime levels were beging
modified).

MPS (for example, `productMPS(sites, "Up")` makes a state with all Up
spins).
