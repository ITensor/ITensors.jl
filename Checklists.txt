Checklist for Tagging a New Release
----------------------------------------------------------
- Update the version = "x.y.z" line near the top of Project.toml
  to be the new version number and commit this change
- On the Github website for ITensors.jl, click on Code tab, 
  then the link to the individual commits (showing total 
  number of commits) then click on a commit occurring on
  or after the change to Project.toml
- In the comments under this commit, add the comment:
  @JuliaRegistrator register
- Wait an hour or so for the JuliaRegistrator bot to
  update the official Julia registry 
- The TagBot bot should also create a new tag and version on Github
  automatically (if you see a notice about "Trigger TagBot Issue"
  it does not mean that TagBot isn't working or has an issue, it 
  is just literally a Github issue used to trigger TagBot to run)
- TagBot helpfully explains the differences from the previous 
  versions in the Github version entry. This can be useful for
  updating the NEWS.md file.

Checklist for Updating the Version of Documenter.jl Used
----------------------------------------------------------
- Edit the docs/Project.toml file, changing only the version
  number for Documenter (under the [compat] section).
- Create a new PR to confirm that the docs build correctly 
  with the new version.

Checklist for Updating the Benchmark CI for New Dependencies
----------------------------------------------------------
- If you update the dependencies of the NDTensors or ITensors
module, the changes need to get reflected in the benchmark
CI setup.
- See benchmark/README.md for detailed instructions.
