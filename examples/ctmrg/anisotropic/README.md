Here is an initial version of a general CTMRG code for contracting an infinite 2D tensor network.

For now, the code only works with a square lattice with a unit cell of 2x2 or larger.

Run a test example of contracting the 2D classical Ising model partition function with `include("main.jl"); main()`.
