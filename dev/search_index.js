They should only take an explicit list of keyword arguments, so as to ensure that an error is thrown if a keyword argument is misspelled or missing (if it has no default value).\nExample: fC above is a leaf function and does not have kwargs... in its signature.\nUse Functions to Set Defaults: Keyword arguments can be made optional by providing default values. To avoid having explicit and possibly inconsistent defaults spread all over the library code, use globally defined functions to provide these defaults. \nFor example:\nfunction sum(A::MPS, B::MPS; cutoff=default_cutoff(), kwargs...)\n...\nend\n\nfunction inner(A::MPS, B::MPS; cutoff=default_cutoff(), kwargs...)\n...\nend\nwhere above the default value for the cutoff keyword is provided by a function default_cutoff()  that is defined for the whole library.\nUse Named Tuples to \"Tunnel\" Keywords to Leaf Functions: This is a more advanced pattern. In certain situations, there might be multiple leaf functions depending on the execution pathway of the code or in cases where the leaf function is a \"callback\" passed into the code from the upper-level calling code.\nIn such cases, different leaf function implementations may expect different sets of keyword arguments.\nTo avoid requiring all leaf functions to take all possible keyword arguments (or to use the kwargs... pattern as a workaround, breaking rule #2 above), use the following pattern:\nfunction fA(callback, psi; callback_args, kwargs...)\n  ...\n  callback(psi; callback_args...)\n  ...\nend\n\nmy_callback(psi; a, b) = ...  # define custom callback function\n\n# Call fA like this:\nfA(my_callback, psi; callback_args = (; a, b))\n","category":"page"},{"location":"CodeTiming.html#Timing-and-Profiling-your-code","page":"Timing and profiling","title":"Timing and Profiling your code","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"CodeTiming.html","page":"Timing and profiling","title":"Timing and profiling","text":"It is very important to time and profile your code to make sure your code is running as fast as possible.

For symmetric tensors (quantum number conserving tensors represented as block sparse tensors), the combiner also fuses symmetry sectors together. They can be used for various purposes.

This is along the same lines as Julia packages like NamedDims.jl and AxisArrays.jl and libraries in Python like xarray, however I would argue that the ITensor approach is a little more sophisticated (the dimensions have more metadata which makes them easier to manipulate for different situations, random ids to help avoid name clashes, etc.). This design was inspired by the needs of tensor network algorithms, where there are many tensor dimensions in the computation (of which many of them are dynamically created during the calculation), but would be helpful for writing other algorithms too.\nThe ITensor type has a dynamic high level interface, where the type itself is mutable and the data can be swapped out. This allows for conveniently allocating the data of an ITensor on the fly \"as needed\", which makes for a nicer, more flexible interface (like initializing an empty ITensor before a loop, and filling it with the correct data type when the first value is set), at the expense of a small overhead for accessing data in the ITensor. We have found this tradeoff is worth it, since we expect ITensors to be used for medium to large scale calculations where operations on the tensors like contraction, addition, and tensor decomposition dominate the cost of the calculation, and code can be designed with function barriers to speed up operations when data is being accessed repeatedly.\nAnother feature that ITensor has that goes beyond what is available in standard Julia, TensorFlow, and PyTorch is tensors which are symmetric under a group action. The physical interpretation of these tensors are ones that have a conserved quantity (like a quantum state with a conserved number of particles), so that feature is more physics-oriented, but could have applications in other areas like machine learning as well. In practice, these tensors are block sparse, and have extra metadata on the dimensions labeling representations of the group.\nBased on the features above, the ITensor library provides high level implementations of tensor network algorithms (algebraic operations of very high dimensional tensors, such as addition, multiplication, and finding dominant eigenvectors). In general these algorithms can (and have been) written on top of other libraries like standard Julia Arrays/AD, PyTorch, or TensorFlow, but they might have various downsides (a less convenient interface for dealing with tensor operations, no support for the types of symmetric tensors we often need, limited support for tensors with complex numbers in the case of libraries like PyTorch, though perhaps that has improved since I last checked, etc.).","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/RelationshipToOtherLibraries.html","page":"Relationship of ITensor to other tensor libraries FAQs","title":"Relationship of ITensor to other tensor libraries FAQs","text":"Although ITensor has primarily focused on quantum physics and quantum computing applications, there is work using ITensor for machine learning applications (so far focused on applications of tensor networks to machine learning, so no neural network calculations yet as far as I know). In general, these different libraries (ITensor, Flux, PyTorch, TensorFlow) are biased towards their specific methods and application areas that they are used for the most: ITensor is more biased towards tensor network calculations and quantum physics/quantum computing applications, based on the available features and interface, while PyTorch and TensorFlow are more biased towards neural network calculations. However, our goal would be to provide more features to ITensor that would make it useful for neural network applications as well, such as better support for slicing operations.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/MPSTimeEvolution.html#MPS-Time-Evolution","page":"MPS Time Evolution","title":"MPS Time Evolution","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/MPSTimeEvolution.html","page":"MPS Time Evolution","title":"MPS Time Evolution","text":"An important application of matrix product state (MPS)  tensor networks in physics is computing the time evolution of a quantum state under the dynamics of a Hamiltonian H.

The flux will be set by the first element that is set.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> i\n(dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\n\njulia> @show ITensor(QN(0), i', dag(i));\nITensor(QN(0), i', dag(i)) = ITensor ord=2\nDim 1: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\")' <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nDim 2: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <In>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nNDTensors.BlockSparse{Float64, Vector{Float64}, 2}\n 3×3\nBlock(1, 1)\n [1:1, 1:1]\n 0.0\n\nBlock(2, 2)\n [2:3, 2:3]\n 0.0  0.0\n 0.0  0.0\n\njulia> @show ITensor(QN(1), i', dag(i));\nITensor(QN(1), i', dag(i)) = ITensor ord=2\nDim 1: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\")' <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nDim 2: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <In>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nNDTensors.BlockSparse{Float64, Vector{Float64}, 2}\n 3×3\nBlock(2, 1)\n [2:3, 1:1]\n 0.0\n 0.0\n\njulia> @show ITensor(ComplexF64, QN(1), i', dag(i));\nITensor(ComplexF64, QN(1), i', dag(i)) = ITensor ord=2\nDim 1: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\")' <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nDim 2: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <In>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nNDTensors.BlockSparse{ComplexF64, Vector{ComplexF64}, 2}\n 3×3\nBlock(2, 1)\n [2:3, 1:1]\n 0.0 + 0.0im\n 0.0 + 0.0im\n\njulia> @show ITensor(undef, QN(1), i', dag(i));\nITensor(undef, QN(1), i', dag(i)) = ITensor ord=2\nDim 1: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\")' <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nDim 2: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <In>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nNDTensors.BlockSparse{Float64, Vector{Float64}, 2}\n 3×3\nBlock(2, 1)\n [2:3, 1:1]\n 0.0\n 1.63e-322\n\nConstruction with undefined flux:\n\njulia> A = ITensor(i', dag(i));\n\njulia> @show A;\nA = ITensor ord=2\nDim 1: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\")' <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nDim 2: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <In>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nNDTensors.EmptyStorage{NDTensors.EmptyNumber, NDTensors.BlockSparse{NDTensors.EmptyNumber, Vector{NDTensors.EmptyNumber}, 2}}\n 3×3\n\n\n\njulia> isnothing(flux(A))\ntrue\n\njulia> A[i' => 1, i => 2] = 2\n2\n\njulia> @show A;\nA = ITensor ord=2\nDim 1: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\")' <Out>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nDim 2: (dim=3|id=212|\"i\") <In>\n 1: QN(0) => 1\n 2: QN(1) => 2\nNDTensors.BlockSparse{Int64, Vector{Int64}, 2}\n 3×3\nBlock(1, 2)\n [1:1, 2:3]\n 2  0\n\njulia> flux(A)\nQN(-1)\n\n\n\n\n\nITensor([::Type{ElT} = Float64,] ::UndefInitializer, flux::QN, inds)\nITensor([::Type{ElT} = Float64,] ::UndefInitializer, flux::QN, inds::Index...)\n\nConstruct an ITensor with indices inds and BlockSparse storage with undefined elements of type ElT, where the nonzero (allocated) blocks are determined by the provided QN flux.

If the agreement is good, then gradually try larger systems and see if the physical properties are roughly consistent and similar (i.e. the density profile has similar features).\nMake sure to check a wide range of properties - not just the energy. See if these look plausible by plotting and visually inspecting them. For example: if your system has  left-right reflection symmetry, does the density or magnetization also have this symmetry?  If the ground  state of your system is expected to have a total S^z of zero, does your  ground state have this property?\nMake sure to run your DMRG calculation for different numbers of sweeps to see if  the results change. For example, if you run DMRG for 5 sweeps but are unsure of convergence, try running it for 10 sweeps: is the energy the same or has it significantly decreased? If 10 sweeps made a difference, try 20 sweeps.\nInspect the the DMRG output.  The ITensor DMRG code reports the maximum bond or link dimension and maximum truncation error after each sweep. (The maximums here mean over each DMRG substep making up one sweep.) Is the maximum dimension or \"maxlinkdim\" reported by the DMRG output quickly reaching  and saturating the maxdim value you set for each sweep? Is the maximum truncation error  \"maxerr\" consistently reaching large values, larger than 1E-5?  Then it you may need to raise the maxdim parameter for your later sweeps,  so that DMRG is allowed to use a larger bond dimension and thus reach a better accuracy.\nCompute the energy variance of an MPS to check whether it is an eigenstate.

To do this, just set the noise parameter of each sweep to a small, non-zero value, making this value very small (1E-11, say) or zero by the last sweep. (Experiment with different values on small systems to see which noise magnitudes help.) Here is an example of  defining DMRG accuracy or sweep parameters with a non-zero noise set for the first three sweeps:\nnsweeps = 10\nmaxdim = [100, 200, 400, 800, 1600]\ncutoff = [1E-6]\nnoise = [1E-6, 1E-7, 1E-8, 0.0]\n...\nenergy, psi = dmrg(H,psi0; nsweeps, maxdim, cutoff, noise)\nTry using a initial MPS with properties close to the ground state you are looking for. For example, the ground state of a system of electrons typically has a density which is spread out over the whole system. So if your initial state has all of the electrons bunched up on the left-hand side only, it can take DMRG a very long time to converge.\nTry using a random MPS with a modestly large bond dimension. ITensor offers a function called randomMPS which can be used to make random MPS in both the quantum number (QN) conserving and non-QN conserving cases. Because random MPS have properties which are \"typical\" of most ground states, they can be good initial states for DMRG.\nTry DMRG on a closely related Hamiltonian for which convergence is easier to obtain (be creative here: it could be your Hamiltonian with interactions turned off, or  with interactions only within, but not between, small local patches). Take the output of this first calculation and use it as input for DMRG with the full Hamiltonian.\nIn stubborn cases, try other methods for finding the ground state which are slower, but have a better chance of succeeding. A key example is imaginary time evolution, which  always reaches the ground state if (a) performed accurately on (b) a state which is  not orthogonal to the ground state. After doing some amount of imaginary time evolution, use the resulting MPS as an initial state for DMRG obtain a higher-accuracy solution.","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/DMRG.html#How-to-do-periodic-boundary-condition-DMRG","page":"DMRG FAQs","title":"How to do periodic boundary condition DMRG","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"faq/DMRG.html","page":"DMRG FAQs","title":"DMRG FAQs","text":"The short answer to how to do fully periodic boundary condition DMRG in ITensor is that you simply input a periodic Hamiltonian into our OpSum system and make the MPO form of your Hamiltonian in the usual way.

The reason is that now every bond of the MPS not only carries local entanglement as with OBC, but also the entanglement between the first and last sites.

To test these predictions numerically, one must  work with large, translationally invariant systems with minimal edge effects. Using fully periodic boundary conditions satisfies these criteria. However, a superior choice is to use infinite DMRG, which combines the much better scaling of open-boundary DMRG with the ability to  measure correlators at arbitrarily long distances by repeating the unit cell of the MPS wavefunction. Although truncating to a finite number of states imposes an effective correlation length on the system, this correlation length can reach many thousands of sites for quite moderate MPS bond dimensions.

Thus one might think that fully periodic BC are the best choice for studying topological phases. However,  topological phases have the same ground-state degeneracy on an infinite cylinder as they do on a torus.[Zhang]. Cincio and Vidal exploited this fact to use infinite DMRG to study a variety of topological phases [Cincio]. One part of their calculation did actually require obtaining ground states on a torus, but they accomplished this by taking a finite segment of an infinite MPS  and connecting its ends. This approach does not give the true ground state of the torus but was sufficient  for their calculation and was arguably closer to the true two-dimensional physics.","category":"page"},{"location":"faq/DMRG.html","page":"DMRG FAQs","title":"DMRG FAQs","text":"[Zhang]: Quasiparticle statistics and braiding from ground-state entanglement, Yi Zhang, Tarun Grover, Ari Turner, Masaki Oshkawa, and Ashvin Vishwanath, Phys.

But using open or infinite boundaries remains  the better choice because they allow much higher accuracy.\nTo deal with the presence of edges in OBC, one can use \"restricted sweeping\". Here one sweeps across the full system to obtain the ground state. Then, to obtain the first excited state one only sweeps through the full system to obtain the ground state. Then, to obtain the first excited state one only sweeps through the near the edges. This traps the particle in a \"soft box\" which still lets its wavefunction mix with the basis that describes the ground state outside the restricted sweeping region.\nWithin infinite DMRG, boundary effects are rigorously absent if the calculation has converged. To compute bulk gaps one again uses a type of restricted sweeping known in the literature as \"infinite boundary conditions\".
