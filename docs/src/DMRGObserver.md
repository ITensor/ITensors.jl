# DMRGObserver

A DMRGObserver is a type of [observer](@ref observer) which
offers certain useful, general purpose capabilities
for DMRG calculations such as measuring custom
local observables at each step and stopping DMRG
early if certain energy convergence conditions are met.

## Sample Usage

In the following example, we have already made a Hamiltonian MPO `H`
and initial MPS `psi0` for a system of spins whose sites
have an associated "Sz" operator defined. We construct a
`DMRGObserver` which measures "Sz" on each site at each
step of DMRG, and also stops the calculation early if
the energy no longer changes to a relative precision of 1E-7.

```
Sz_observer = DMRGObserver(["Sz"],sites,energy_tol=1E-7)

energy, psi = dmrg(H,psi0,sweeps,observer=Sz_observer)

for (sw,Szs) in enumerate(measurements(Sz_observer)["Sz"])
  println("Total Sz after sweep $sw = ", sum(Szs)/N)
end
```
