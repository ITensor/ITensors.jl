    ITensors.compile(; path = "~/.julia/sysimages",
                       filename = "sys_itensors.so")

Compile ITensors.jl with [PackageCompiler](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/).

This will take some time, perhaps a few minutes. This will create the file `sys_itensors.so`, by default in the directory `~/.julia/sysimages/`. This is a version of Julia that is compiled with ITensors. After running this command, if you start Julia with:
```
~ julia --sysimage ~/.julia/sysimages/sys_itensors.so
```
and you should see the startup time and JIT compilation time are substantially improved when you are using ITensors.

You can create an alias like:
```
~ alias julia_itensors="julia --sysimage ~/.julia/sysimages/sys_itensors.so"
```
(which you can put in your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.). Then you can start Julia with a version of ITensors installed with the command:
```
~ julia_itensors
```

Note that if you update ITensors to a new version, for example with `Pkg.update("ITensors")`, you will need to run this command again to recompile the new version of ITensors.
